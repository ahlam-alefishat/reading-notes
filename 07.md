# Express
## Express Routing
### Event driven system
- `app.get('/thing', (req,res) => {})`
- This is the same pattern we see in Vanilla JS, jQuery
- ‘When a get event happens in our server, on “/thing”, run this function…’
### The Request Object
- * (req,..)
- /:parameters
- ` app.get('/api/:thing',...) = req.params.thing`
- Query Strings
- ` http://server/route?ball=round = req.query.ball`
### The Response Object
- (..., res)
- Responsible for sending data back to the browser
- Has methods like send() and status() that Express uses to format the output to the browser properly
- * Sends Headers
- * Cookies
- * Status Codes

# Middleware
**Middleware** functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

- Application-level middleware
- Router-level middleware
- Error-handling middleware
- Built-in middleware
- Third-party middleware

You can load application-level and router-level middleware with an optional mount path. You can also load a series of middleware functions together, which creates a sub-stack of the middleware system at a mount point.

# Express :
**Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.**

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function.

These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called “handler functions”) called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. In other words, the application “listens” for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

In fact, the routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments. With multiple callback functions, it is important to provide next as an argument to the callback function and then call next() within the body of the function to hand off control to the next callback.

#### **Route methods : is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.**

#### **Route paths : in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.**
- The characters ?, +, *, and () are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.
- If you need to use the dollar character ($) in a path string, enclose it escaped within ([ and ]). For example, the path string for requests at “/data/$book”, would be “/data/([\$])book”.

#### **Route handlers: You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there’s no reason to proceed with the current route. Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.**

## HTTP Status Codes
1. 1xx Informational
2. 2xx Success
3. 3xx Redirection
4. 4xx Client Error
5. 5xx Server Error
