Vocabulary                   |  Definition

database                     | is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a                                       computer system.
  data model | define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.
  CRUD  | represents an acronym for the database operations Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
  schema| is a collection of database objects including tables, views, triggers, stored procedures, indexes, etc.
  sanitize| means that you remove all dangerous characters from an input string before passing it to the SQL engine.
  Structured Query Language (SQL)| is a programming nomenclature used to do set operations (like union, intersect, and minus) to organize and retrieve information in relational databases, based on â€œset theory and relational algebra.
  Non SQL (NoSQL)| database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
  MongoDB|  is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.
  Mongoose| is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. ... MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database. It means you can store JSON documents in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL databases.
  record| is a group of related data held within the same structure.
  document| is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents.
  Object Relation Mapping (ORM)  | in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.
# In Memory Database Testing
## Testing Node.js + Mongoose with an in-memory database
   - In-memory database pros & cons
     - * Pros:
       - No need for mocks
       - Faster development
       - More reliable tests
       - Tests are easier to build
     - * Cons:
       - The in-memory database probably needs seeding
       - More memory usage (dah)
       - Tests take longer to run (depending on your hardware).
# The Repository Design Pattern
  - the important thing you must remember is that design patterns do not depend on specific technology, framework or programming language.
  -  A design pattern is not a design which is directly transferred into code(source or machine).
  - Repository pattern separates the data access logic and maps it to the business entities in the business logic.
  - Communication between the data access logic and the business logic  is done through interfaces.
  - **The separation of data access from business logic have many benefits. Some of them are:**
    - Centralization of the data access logic makes code easier to maintain
    - Business and data access logic can be tested separately
    - Reduces duplication of code
    - A lower chance for making programming errors
