# TCP Servers
  - EventEmitterâ€™s are a great way to handle controlling asynchronous events. 
## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model)
  -  was developed as a seven layer model. This seven layer OSI model has continued to accurately describe the different processes in computer networking, and is still widely used as a point of reference while working in networked systems today.
  - **Layer**
    - 7. Application
    - 6. Presentation
    - 5. Session
    - 4. Transport
    - 3. Network
    - 2. Data Link
    - 1. Physical
## Internet Protocol Suite
  - conceptual model for the protocols used by the internet.
  - referred to as `TCP/IP` because the `IP` and `TCP` were the original protocols in the suite. 
  - using four layers - Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. 
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol )**
      -  widely used by application layer protocols in the Internet Protocol Suite.
      - reates a two way communication between two hosts and provides reliable, ordered, and error checked byte streams between the applications. 
    - **TCP HEADER**
      - used at each end to control the type of interaction being sent.
