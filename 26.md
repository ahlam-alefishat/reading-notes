# Component Based UI
  - `React`, `Angular`, `Vue` 
  - Rather than view an application as an enormous interconnected codebase, the application is a composition of components that work together to make the application work.
  - The secret sauce is how they work together.
  - We use Classes and Functions to classify functionality
  - We require what we need
  - We render it where we want
  - We pay attention to state and react as it changes.
## React
  - As a component based system, React does an awful lot for us, principally, it gets out out of the way and makes it EASY to implement your application the way you see it, using familiar tools.
  - *JSX* looks like markup, but itâ€™s actually Javascript.
##JSX
  -  is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code.
  - **Why JSX?**
    - inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.     
## CSS Compatible
  - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries.
  - Core Team has worked endlessly to not only keep up, but stay ahead.
