From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 5: “Images” 
- The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

## Adding image:

#### Where to Place Images in Your Code?
1. before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2. 2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3. 3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.
