### HTML
#### Introduction : First how the web works?
when any user visit any random website there is a hidden process between browsers ,server and you as a client.

### Structure of HTML:
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.<p> is the opening tag.
- Attributes must have a name and a value.for example(<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>)
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
- HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages:

### Extra markup:
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

### HTML5 Layout:
-The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

### Process & Design:
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

### JavaScript:
- script is group of insruction for the computer.
- to approach writing a script , divied ypur goal to small tasks and then group them together.
