# Custom Hooks
  - **What are custom hooks?**
    - 1. Extract duplicated logic from components
    - 2. Share common functionality
    - 3. Take advantage of useEffect lifecycle

  - **Common use cases**
    - Handle forms easily
    - Pre-fetch API data
    - Connect to services (like socket.io, Q)

  - **Hooks** 
    - are just functions! Anything that is a function can become a Hook. I feel that the documentation on the ReactJS docs site is not simple enough.
    - are a new addition in React that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.
