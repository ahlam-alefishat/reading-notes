## MobX
  - **MobX** is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution. 
  - This tutorial will teach you all the important concepts of MobX in ten minutes.

    - State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. 
   - **MobX** makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: 
     - it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. 
     - `The strategy to achieve that is simple:` 
       - Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived.
