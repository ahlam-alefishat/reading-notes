- you can use a variable to store number  string and boolean values.
- array is a special variable that can store more than one value.
- Expressions evaluate into a single value and they  rely on operators to calculate a value. 

#### Decisions and Loops:

- Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
