## Database Normalization: 
* is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

## Reasons for Database Normalization:
* There are three main reasons to normalize a database. 
- 1. The first is to minimize duplicate data.
- 2. The second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues. 
- 3. The third is to simplify queries. 

## Definition of Database Normalization:
- *First Normal Form : The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.*
- *Second Normal Form : The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.*
- *Third Normal Form : the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.*
