# React Native
  - *React Native* is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. 
  - you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like `JSX`, `components`, `state`, and `props`.
  - *React Native* combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
# Native Development For Everyone
  - React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core set of platform agnostic native components like View, Text, and Image that map directly to the platform’s native UI building blocks.
# Seamless Cross-Platform
  - React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.
## Ejecting to ExpoKit
   - is deprecated and will no longer be supported after SDK 38.
   -  is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using `Xcode`, `Android Studio`, or `react-native init`.
   - **The following steps are for converting a pure-JS Expo project (such as one created with Expo CLI) into a native iOS and Android project which depends on ExpoKit.**
     - 1. Install Expo CLI 
     - 2. Make sure you have the necessary configuration options in app.json
     - 3. Eject
     - 4. Set up and Run your native project
     - 5. Make native changes
     - 6. Distribute your app
