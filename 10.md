# Stacks and Queues
# Stacks 
  - **What is a Stack?**
     - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. 
     - Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
  - **Common terminology for a stack is:**
    - Push
      - Push O(1)
    - Pop  
       - Pop O(1)
    - Top 
    - Peek
      - Peek O(1) 
    - IsEmpty
      - IsEmpty O(1)
  - `FILO` (First In Last Out)
    - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
  - `LIFO` (Last In First Out)
    - This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.
  
# Queues
  - **Common terminology for a queue is:**
    - 1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
      - Enqueue O(1)
    - 2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.
      - Dequeue O(1) 
    - 3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
    - 4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
    - 5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue.
      - Peek O(1)
    - 6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
  - `FIFO` (First In First Out)
    - This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.
  - `LILO` (Last In Last Out)
    - This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
