# Component Composition
  - Using `react-router`, you can easily toggle the visibility of components (or even pages) based on the URL/Route that the user engages with.
# Logical
  - you are sending your child components the raw data and allowing them to render the output as they decide.
# Using Logic-less Children
  - is typically used when your `children` are already in JSX form (pre-rendered) and you need to display them as a whole. 
## These are the concepts you should know in React.js
  - 1. The Component Lifecycle
    - most important concept on this list
    - is exactly what it sounds like: it details the life of a component.
  - 2. Higher-Order Components `HOCs`
    - is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
  - 3. React State and setState()
    - The only way you should change state is via the setState method.
  - 4. React Context
    -  allows you to create global context objects that can be given to any component you make. 
    - This allows you to share data without having to pass props down all the way through the DOM tree.
  - 5. Stay up to date with React!
    - It’s simply keeping up with the latest releases of React. React has made some serious changes lately and it’s only going to continue to grow and develop.
